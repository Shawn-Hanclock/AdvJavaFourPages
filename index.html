              <p>&emsp;For the time spent in Calculus courses, there are many techniques and methods students may come
                to be
                familiar with, the very techniques that make up calculus. Except there is more, what one may also learn
                and come to know are the many different graphs, common graphs for functions show up constantly. The
                ability to recognize the functions that are at play being important for building intution in approaching
                any problem, and will, for certain, support the journey in elementary calculus.</p>
              <p>Explore the menu and you will find in these webpages, the many graphs of Calculus <br>
                from <i><mark>Calc AB</mark></i> to <i><mark>Calc BC</mark></i>.<br></p>

          <p>Dear User:<br></p>
          <p>The webpages you are about to traverse were done for the the purposes of a class assignment, if information
            is inaccurate or page interactions non-functional please excuse it as work done by a student in the process
            of learning. If you find discrepancies in time stamps or dates, please note that the student responsable was
            poor at time management. </p>
          <p>Of the content you may find on this site it is worth mentioning that it is in no way comprehensive,
            although it may have tried to be, of all the functions typical students learn in AP Calclus. The creator of
            this site hopes that any information here might helpful, so hopefully it may be helpful.<br></p>
          <p>Sincerely,</p>
